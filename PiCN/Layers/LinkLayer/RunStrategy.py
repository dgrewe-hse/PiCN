"""Run strategies for BasicLinkLayer.

See docs/design-adrs/ADR-008-baseinterface-contract.md's 2026-08-04 addendum
for the full rationale. In short: BasicLinkLayer is production code every
ProgramLib already depends on, so it cannot simply be rewritten in place the
way Phase 2's purely-additive AsyncLayerProcess/AsyncLayerStack were. Instead
BasicLinkLayer takes an injected LinkLayerRunStrategy deciding what actually
happens inside its dedicated forked process:

- SyncRunStrategy reproduces today's LayerProcess.start_process() exactly.
  It is the default, so every existing ProgramLib is completely unaffected.
- AsyncRunStrategy runs a real asyncio engine instead, opt-in per ProgramLib.

Both live in this one module because they implement the same seam and are
meant to be read side by side.

Phase 5 promotes the engine to AsyncBasicLinkLayer for use inside
AsyncLayerStack (no fork). AsyncRunStrategy reuses that class with a
multiprocessing-Queue bridge for the Phase-3 opt-in path.
